Documentation for Stats\+Test.\+py we would be using t-\/tests and A\+N\+O\+VA for analysis. Script.\+stat package is used; ttest\+\_\+ind and f\+\_\+oneway functions are performed. Null Hypothesis (H0)\+: There is no significant difference between the strategies. Alternative Hypothesis (H1)\+: There are significant differences between the strategies. We use 0.\+05 for the significant level. we use a Tukey post hoc analysis to confirm where the differences occurred between greedy-\/based strategies\+: Epsilon-\/\+Greedy, Epsilon-\/\+Decreasing, Hybrid\#2, and Hybrid\#4.
