\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Documentation for test\+\_\+\+Greedy\+Strategies.\+py We test decreasing-\/epsilon, greedy-\/epsilon, hybrid\#1, hybrid\#2, hybrid\#3, hybrid\#4, and hybrid\#5 functions from Greedy\+Strategies.\+py with expected results. These tests help us to ensure that our network is working and consistent. With these tests, we can know our single-\/layer perceptron works. Since all functions from add\+Data.\+py, Contextual\+Bandit.\+py, Contexutual\+Bandit\+Agent.\+py, and Initialize\+Tensor.\+py are utilized in the Greedy-\/based strategies, we test all functions at once! We will have seven tests with different random seed each and match with expected results in one trial.
